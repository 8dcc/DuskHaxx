# DuskHaxx
**A useless mod for singleplayer dusk.**

Did it because I was bored.

Based on [CometVTwo](https://github.com/TheReal3rd/CometVTwo).

### Features
- Godmode.
- Aimbot (See todo).
- Rapid fire.
- Unlimited ammo.
- Enemy ESP (tracers, base and 3d box).
- Debug player position.
- Console (Not recommended yet).

### How to use
- Hold `Insert` to bring mouse and show the menu (depending on the settings).
- `Insert` + `Number` to toggle options.
- `Insert` + `k` to toggle console (Not recommended).
- `Delete` to exit.

### How to inject
Use a monoinjector like [SharpMonoInjector](https://github.com/warbler/SharpMonoInjector).
